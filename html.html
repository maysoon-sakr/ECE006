<h2>What is HTML?</h2>

<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements are represented by tags
HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page</p>
<h2> HTML uses</h2>
<p>From what we mentioned earlier there is no doubt that you have noticed that it is not a programming language in the common sense, because the uses of the HTML language are limited to:

 HTML is used for marking web pages, as it is the language for building and creating websites.
 One of the basics of programming is that without it, the sites will not appear in this way, as HTML defines the website browser as the site’s content sites.
 This language is the language in which websites and web pages are designed easily through the use of notepad or similar programs.</p>
